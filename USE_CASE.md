# Apache Spark Monitoring Extension

Apache Spark is a fast and general purpose cluster computing system. It provides high level APIs in Java, Scala, Python & R as well as an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a tool called Spark SQL for SQL and relational data processing.

The AppDynamics Spark Extension can monitor multiple Spark clusters and worker nodes and extracts metrics from every running and completed Spark application, more specifically the jobs, executors, stages and storage RDDs within these applications. The metrics reported by the extension can be configured by users.
